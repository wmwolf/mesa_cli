mesa_cli
========

Command line tools for use with open source MESA stellar evolution code.

I don't think this tool is done yet, but I wanted to get it out there. So far
require ruby, MesaScript, thor, and a working mesa directory accessed by
`$MESA\_DIR`.

## Installation ##

1. Make sure you have Ruby 1.8.7 or higher (1.9.3 recommended)
2. Install [mesascript](http://wmwolf.github.io/MesaScript/).
3. Install the Thor gem via

        sudo gem install thor

4. Place `mesa` file in your path
5. Type `mesa help` to list the commands and see what they do
6. Type `mesa help command` to learn about an individual command

More documentation to come soon!
